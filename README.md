# MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines Repository! This repository is dedicated to showcasing and documenting various MongoDB aggregation stages and CRUD operations. It serves as a comprehensive resource for developers looking to understand and implement aggregation pipelines in MongoDB.

### What is Aggregation?

Aggregation operations process data records and return computed results. Aggregation operations group values from multiple documents together and can perform a variety of operations on the grouped data to return a single result. In SQL, aggregation refers to operations like `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MAX`, and `MIN`.

### Why Use Aggregation?

Aggregation allows you to:
- Summarize and transform data efficiently.
- Perform complex data manipulations in a single query.
- Handle data from different collections and join them using `$lookup`.

### Basic Aggregation Stages

#### `$match`
The `$match` stage filters documents. It is similar to the `find` method in MongoDB and uses the same syntax.

**Example:**
```json
[
  {
    "$match": { "status": "A" }
  }
]
```

#### `$group`
The `$group` stage groups input documents by a specified identifier expression and applies the accumulator expressions.

**Example:**
```json
[
  {
    "$group": { "_id": "$cust_id", "total": { "$sum": "$amount" } }
  }
]
```

#### `$project`
The `$project` stage reshapes each document in the stream, such as by adding new fields or removing existing fields.

**Example:**
```json
[
  {
    "$project": { "item": 1, "discountedPrice": { "$multiply": ["$price", 0.9] } }
  }
]
```

#### `$sort`
The `$sort` stage sorts all input documents and returns them in sorted order.

**Example:**
```json
[
  {
    "$sort": { "date": -1 }
  }
]
```

#### `$lookup`
The `$lookup` stage performs a left outer join to a collection in the same database to filter in documents from the “joined” collection for processing.

**Example:**
```json
[
  {
    "$lookup": {
      "from": "otherCollection",
      "localField": "order_id",
      "foreignField": "order_id",
      "as": "orderDetails"
    }
  }
]
```
