MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines Repository
Overview
Welcome to the MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines Repository! This repository is dedicated to showcasing and documenting various MongoDB aggregation stages and CRUD operations. It serves as a comprehensive resource for developers looking to understand and implement aggregation pipelines in MongoDB.

What is Aggregation?
Aggregation operations process data records and return computed results. Aggregation operations group values from multiple documents together and can perform a variety of operations on the grouped data to return a single result. In SQL, aggregation refers to operations like SUM, COUNT, AVG, MAX, and MIN.

Why Use Aggregation?
Aggregation allows you to:

Summarize and transform data efficiently.
Perform complex data manipulations in a single query.
Handle data from different collections and join them using $lookup.
Basic Aggregation Stages
$match
The $match stage filters documents. It is similar to the find method in MongoDB and uses the same syntax.

Example:

json
Copy code
[
  {
    "$match": { "status": "A" }
  }
]
$group
The $group stage groups input documents by a specified identifier expression and applies the accumulator expressions.

Example:

json
Copy code
[
  {
    "$group": { "_id": "$cust_id", "total": { "$sum": "$amount" } }
  }
]
$project
The $project stage reshapes each document in the stream, such as by adding new fields or removing existing fields.

Example:

json
Copy code
[
  {
    "$project": { "item": 1, "discountedPrice": { "$multiply": ["$price", 0.9] } }
  }
]
$sort
The $sort stage sorts all input documents and returns them in sorted order.

Example:

json
Copy code
[
  {
    "$sort": { "date": -1 }
  }
]
$lookup
The $lookup stage performs a left outer join to a collection in the same database to filter in documents from the “joined” collection for processing.

Example:

json
Copy code
[
  {
    "$lookup": {
      "from": "otherCollection",
      "localField": "order_id",
      "foreignField": "order_id",
      "as": "orderDetails"
    }
  }
]
